		<div class="twelvecol content-class">
			<p>Wouter Nuytten is founder and CEO of Octopin, Pinterest Marketing Suite. After barely six months of development, he’s ready to make his move to the States, to Silicon Valley. Read all about it.</p><br/>
			<p><b>Wouter, could you explain in a few words how you got here?</b></p><br/>
			<p>I’ve been coding since the age of twelve. I soon realized that high school wasn’t for me. The day I turned 18, I dropped out. I began working at an advertising agency as a developer. Being limited in projects, I ended my contract after 6 months. I felt ready to start my own business. Dreamline Studios was my first company, where I did some freelance work as a developer. In my free time I started exploring several ideas, educating myself into the startup world. Owning a small company in web development, I wanted to run an advertising campaign through several social media channels to raise awareness. One of those channels was Pinterest. I soon realized that Pinterest is very limited for small businesses and brands. The results of Pinterest AD campaigns are tremendous, but the process of running one is very frustrating. I saw a market opportunity and started developing Octopin. From September to December 2012 I started building it with the guidance of Idealabs.</p><br/>			<p>2012 was the year of coding and thinking. Building, testing, measuring and learning. 2013 will be the year of go-to-market and profit!</p><br/>
			<p><b>Why Silicon Valley and what holds the future for Octopin?</b></p><br/>
			<p>First we planned to go to New York, going after all the big Advertising agencies. We slowed things down, and chose for Silicon Valley. We set up objectives that we’re trying to achieve in the US.</p><br/>
			<p>First one is to start an investment round. Several Belgian parties are already interested in investing in Octopin. We want to combine that with investments from the US. One of the reasons why we chose for Silicon Valley, is because we are getting guidance from a VC through the iMinds Go West Program. After talking at Stima2012 this year, I got in touch with Davy Kestens from Twitspark who’s offering me a place to work while I’m in the US. He also introduced me to Sebastien de Halleux (Playfish), who will introduce me to potential investors.</p><br/>
			<p>The second objective is getting in touch with Pinterest. They are also based in Silicon Valley.</p><br/>
			<p>Third objective is introducing Octopin on the US Pinterest market. We aren’t going after big brands only. We adapted our business model, and found it to be meaningful if we tailor a solution for SME’s. After all, 50 % of the Pinterest users are located in the US.</p><br/>
			<p><b>You mention you don’t aim only for big brands. What’s your main target audience then?</b></p><br/>
			<p>During the first months of Octopin, we targeted Big Brands. That worked for the Belgian and European market. Octopin is used by KLM, Heinz, Adobe. After analyzing the potential markets, we saw a gap none of our competitors are operating in. Our 2 main competitors are going after the Big Brands. Right now we’re developing a business model to attract small companies and even freelancers or individuals. Our current package is too big of an investment for those companies, so we’re thinking about a low investment solution to satisfy them as well. So we want to serve the complete B2B market and even B2C.</p><br/>
			<p><b>If Pinterest starts its own analytics dashboard, would you be ready for that kind of competition?</b></p><br/>
			<p>We already have two major competitors, but even if Pinterest joins that list, we wouldn’t get scared. We always have an edge because of the complete package of well-developed features. We see clearly that we are always a few steps ahead of the competition on the markets we’re operating in. The only challenge is the fact that we are still quite unknown. Our competitors are in business for a little longer and took advantage of the massive amounts of attention and press Pinterest got early 2012. We didn’t. We’ll have to make up for this with clever marketing.</p><br/>
			<p><b>How will Pinterest evolve as a platform? Do you see challenges in the fact that it’s dominated by women? Does this limit your possibilities?</b></p><br/>
			<p>It’s true that Pinterest is dominated by women, but only in the States. In the UK it’s even the opposite, men are in majority. So it depends on location, but even in the States, men are catching up. Pinterest focused on the product and their user-base so far. Now they are looking for new capital to expand their features, marketing, revenue and in the end their user base. I expect things like brand pages, e-commerce to buy stuff without leaving Pinterest. I expect a large growth for Pinterest because internet is getting more and more visual.</p><br/>
			<p><b>What’s your long-term goal with Octopin? Are you setting up to sell in a few years or do you want to keep building?</b></p><br/>
			<p>We developed a technology to recognize images and link them to the company that originally posted or published it, even if there is no mention of the company. Let’s say someone pins a sweater, our technology will recognize the sweater and know what brand it is. This creates almost limitless opportunities in the future. So maybe we won’t stop with Pinterest. Maybe we will expand to other platforms. But that’s for the future. Now it’s time to go to San Francisco and focus on the Pinterest solution!</p><br/>
